drumkv1 - an old-school drum-kit sampler
----------------------------------------

ChangeLog


GIT HEAD

- Dropped the --enable-qt5 from configure as found redundant
  given that's the build default anyway (suggestion by Guido
  Scholz, while for Qtractor, thanks).


0.7.4  2016-03-02  The ninth-bis official beta.

- Fixed the DCF Formant filter voice initialization reset.
- French translation updated (by Olivier Humbert, thanks).


0.7.3  2016-02-22  The ninth official beta.

- Avoid out-of-bound MIDI events as much as possible, coping
  with LV2 plug-in hosts that feed/run them in on border line
  circumstances (as reported by Thorsten Wilms, on suspected
  Ardour looping crash/bug, probably fixed already, thanks).
- Tentatively safe defaults are being introduced to internal
  OUT FX buffer-sizes, as read from JACK buffer-size changes
  and LV2 block-length instantiation bound options.
- Added application keywords to freedesktop.org's AppData.


0.7.2  2015-12-04  The eighth official beta.

- A brand new LFO BPM control parameter is being introduced,
  as a subordinate to LFO Rate, with follow/sync to current
  transport/host option (BPM=Auto).
- LFO Sync (free running) mode option has been introduced.
- A fourth DCF type has been added: a vocal Formant filter.
- A third DCF slope/type has been added: the RBJ's bi-quad.
- Prefer Qt5 over Qt4 by default with configure script.
- Introducing brand new OUT FX Send parameter per key/element.
- Fixed an old bug that caused an immediate crash on triggering
  any sample key/element with its (exclusive) Group parameter
  set to anything but "Off" or "1".


0.7.1  2015-08-24  A seventh-bis official beta.

- Fixed a recent bug/mistake that was causing a complete reset/
  revert of all element parameters to prior values upon loading
  an element sample file.
- Improved Qt4 vs. Qt5 configure builds (via qmake).


0.7.0  2015-07-24  A seventh official beta.

- Complete rewrite of Qt4 vs. Qt5 configure builds.
- Reset ramps after LV2 control port reconnection; small fixes
  to LV2.ttl (pull-requests by Hanspeter Portner aka. ventosus,
  on synthv1, thanks).
- MIDI Controllers/Programs is now an optional feature on the
  LV2 plugin forms, as some LV2 hosts might enforce the purity
  restriction to input control ports as being absolutely read-
  only parameter values from a plugin's instance perspective.
- MIDI Controller mapping/learn is now possible on all parameter
  control knobs; with global configuration also avaiable on the
  Help/Configure dialog.
- French (fr) translation line to desktop file added (by Olivier
  Humbert, thanks).


0.6.3  2015-05-09  A sixth official beta.

- Sample file drag-and-drop support has been added to the note
  element list widget.
- Main widget layout changed as much to allow sampler display
  and element list to expand or grow vertically as needed.


0.6.2  2015-04-30  A fifth official beta.

- Sample file path mapping has been fixed for LV2 plugin state
  restoration, which were preventing Ardour to reload any of
  the saved session or preset sample files in particular.
- Custom knob/dial behavior mode options are now introduced:
  linear and angular (aka. radial) as far to avoid abrupt
  changes on first mouse click (still the default behavior).
- Fixed for some strict tests for Qt4 vs. Qt5 configure builds.


0.6.1  2015-03-09  A fourth official beta.

- Added application description as freedesktop.org's AppData.
- Introducing LV2 port-groups (as proposed by Amadeus Folego aka.
  badosu, thanks).
- Improved envelope widget nodes click-and-drag precision.
- Sample file drag-and-drop support has been added.
- Introducing a brand new user preference on eye-candy: cf.Help
  /Configure.../Options/Custom style theme (applies to the JACK
  stand-alone client only though).
- Envelope and filter now rendered with anti-aliased lines.
- Fixed a Qt5 FTBFS re. QHeaderView::set[Section]ResizeMode().


0.6.0  2014-01-23  A third official beta.

- MIDI bank-select/program-changes is now supported, for patch,
  preset and/or instrument program control.
- New Help/Configure dialog is introduced for editing the also
  new MIDI bank/programs interface and user preference options
  as well (new home of the old Help/Use native dialogs option).
- Presets may now be specified by base name, as an alternative
  to the complete preset file-path on command line argument (re.
  stand-alone JACK client).
- Fixed parameters A/B comparison swap.


0.5.1  2014-09-12  One second official beta.

- Fixed LV2 plugin relative/absolute file path state resolution.
- One decimal digit added to all scalar parameters and knobs.
- Stand-alone JACK client ports outrageously renamed from a
  zero based numbering scheme into a plus one natural one.
- Experimental LV2 Time/position atom-event support (Delay BPM).


0.5.0  2014-06-30  Officially beta now.

- LV2 UI Idle and Show interfaces support added.
- First attempt to allow a headless stand-alone JACK client
  application run mode, without a GUI, with option given as
  command line argument (--no-gui).
- A man page has beed added (re. stand-alone JACK client).
- Reverse sample option and parameter knob added.
- Allow the build system to include an user specified LDFLAGS.


0.4.2  2014-04-29  A pre-LAC frenzy beta.

- Badly named 'Noise' wave-shapes re-labeled as 'Rand'; also
  a brand new wave-shape 'Noise' is then introduced (now for
  real :)).
- New user preference option, cf. Help/Use native dialogs.
- An anti-denormal regression applied to the Phaser fx stage
  (affecting early proto-beta >= 0.4.0).


0.4.1  2014-04-07  A proto-beta bis.

- Once so called 'Noise' wave-shapes are now being made a lot
  more deterministic, read idempotent ;).
- Late optimizations to basic wave-table oscillators.
- Make sure the LV2 plugin back-end always builds first, before
  its respective LV2 UI front-end client.


0.4.0  2014-03-06  A proto-beta party.

- All knobs default value setting slightly improved.
- A run-time circumvention have been hacked, strictly related
  to when NSM session management is in charge: the native file
  browser/requester dialogs are then disabled (were taking too
  long to list the current directory on first time invocation).
- Auto-detection of the correct target library path for the
  LV2 plugin, whether it may be .../lib or .../lib64 on bi
  -arch targets, when libdir is not specified on configure
  time (--libdir=LIBDIR).
- Reverb has been added as a brand new effects stage, though
  based on good old FreeVerb :).
- Introduced a variable env.stage time control parameter.
- Purging out some dead code (eg. non-looping, zero-crossing).


0.3.6  2013-12-31  A fifth of a Jubilee.

- Effects/Delay BPM sync option to current transport (Auto).
- Fixed for relative paths on preset file references.
- More preparations for Qt5 configure build.


0.3.5  2013-09-30  Fall greetings.

- First attempt on separating the DSP code from UI as runtime
  objects, effective for the LV2 plugin deploy.
- MIDI channel filter switch is now introduced.
- Fixed uninstall target make rule.
- Another minor fix to note-off fast-release.


0.3.4  2013-07-16  Brand new icon ready.

- Preset file icon and mimetype now introduced.
- A brand new icon drops the lamest old-schooler's out, in a
  master lesson taught by Jarle Richard Akselsen, thanks.


0.3.3  2013-05-31  Late spring blossoming

- Some sympathy to extreme dark color (read black) schemes is
  now being indulged; some discrete changes on the icon front
  has also emerged ;)

  recognized, in addition to MIDI channel pressure/aftertouch
  processing.
- Parameter value ramping moved into the late post-processing,
  an attempt to reduce some pop/click artifacts even further.
- NSM support introduced to JACK client.
- A slight GUI behavior change: (re)writing existing names
  doesn't load the respective preset anymore (after ticket
  by Jiri Prochazka aka. Anchakor, thanks).
- Introducing LV2 External UI "rougue" support.
- Moog-like 24dB/oct resonant filter slight modification.
- Fixed JACK client fail/fake initialization.
- Fixed a current element switching bug (via GUI) which was
  confusing the (stereo)width, panning and volume settings
  effect from previous selected elements.

- Envelope generators stage curves now gone a little more old-
  schooler and analog-like, hopefully improving on the punchy
  and click-less sound front.

- Preparations for Qt5 migration.


0.3.0  2012-12-21  Third coming release.

- Dropped all SSE dummy build optimization flags as they were
  making more harm than real good, performance wise.
- GUI layout moved from a toolbox into a stacked tab widget;
  also, a status-bar has been added at the bottom display.
- LV2 Atom/MIDI event processing is now official, a replacement
  for the formerly deprecated LV2 Event/MIDI specification.
